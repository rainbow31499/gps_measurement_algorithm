    "In this notebook we will explore the problem of locating an unknown point based on the known distances from known points. The problem will involve a lot of triangle geometry. Using the known distances, it is possible to derive certain properties of the point. In which case, we want to find the intersection of spheres. We know, for example, that the intersection of two spheres in 3-dimensional space with different centers is either a circle or empty, and the intersection of a circle with a sphere is either at most two different points or empty. This notion can be generalized into multidimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out where the circle is, we need to use triangle geometry. This leads us to the first question: If we have two points a known distance apart, and the third point is a known distance away from each of the two points, where is the third point? In 2D space there are two such points. Since isometric transformations do not change the nature of the problem (except for scaling), it suffices to assume the two points lie on the x-axis, which are $(0,0)$ and $(d,0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By solving this question, we will also know the projection and rejection of the third point onto the vector connecting the other two points. The projection is basically the distance of the third point from the first parallel to the line connecting to the first two points. The rejection is the perpendicular distance from the line. However, there are problems that will occur if we don't choose our parameters properly. This will only work when the three distances are compatible with the triangle inequality. Otherwise, one way to solve the problem is to scale the two measured sides proportionally so that they \"just\" satisfy the triangle inequality. The rationale for this will be explained later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools we will use to find the projection and rejection of the third point include Heron's formula and the cosine rule."

    "Based on the results of the experiment and running it several times, it is inconclusive which weighting scheme produces the most accurate results. In fact many different experiments shows that any of these weighting schemes is the winner. This means at least according to what we can find from this experiment, any weighting algorithm could be the winner since there's no significant difference between each of the four. We might as well just use the default equal-weighted average."

    "Now we move on to creating a new algorithm for measuring a point in any number of dimensions. In $n$-dimensional space, we know that $n$ planes of dimension $n-1$ whose normal vectors are not coplanar will intersect at exactly one point. How do we find the plane? From the triangulation algorithm before, we only need to use the projection, which is the distance of the third point parallel to the vector conncting the first two points. Given this projection, this determines a $n-1$-dimensional plane normal to the base vector. Any plane normal to a vector $(a_1,...,a_n)$ will have the equation $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+...+a_nx_n=b$, and $b$ is a constant determined by the location of the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we use the triangulation algorithm to find $n$ planes based on the projections. We pick one satellite as the point from which we will measure the projections onto $n$ vectors, which will require $n$ other points. From exactly $n+1$ points which are not coplanar, we can determine the intersection of all $n$ planes. If the $n$ planes have equations $a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+...+a_{1n}x_n=b_1, a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+...+a_{2n}x_n=b_2, ..., a_{n1}x_1+a_{n2}x_2+...+a_{nn}x_n=b_n$, this is equal to solving the matrix equation $A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{b}$ where $A$ is the matrix of entries $(a_{ij})$ and $\\textbf{b}=(b_1,b_2,...,b_n)$. This requires that $A$ be invertible, which is the condition derived from the fact that the points are not coplanar. To measure whether $A$ is invertible, we can use the determinant of the unit vectors. We shall use this determinant rather than that of $A$ itself because it is not affected by scaling, but is rather a measure of how coplanar the points are, with 1 being an orthogonal basis and 0 being coplanar. The rationale behind this derives from the fact that determinant is the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the vectors. Then we pick another set of $n+1$ satellites for which to repeat the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we shall build a function to implement this method by picking $n+1$ points of dimension $n$ and using measured distances to an unknown point. However, the algorithm will reject any measurement whose determinant of unit vectors is too small in absolute value, equivalently saying that the points lie too closely in one plane, and so either the equation is unsolvable or deviates too much."

    "Now we shall move on to running an experiment in the real world, that is to simulate what this would look like when measured using GPS satellites and sensors on the Earth. In this experiment we shall assume that the Earth is a perfect sphere (it's not really, but more like an ellipsoid), and take measures of latitude, longitude, and altitude in place of Cartesian coordinates. To do this we shall first create functions to convert spherical long/lat/alt coordinates on Earth into Cartesian coordinates, and vice versa. The Cartesian coordinate system we shall use is in units of meters, and the x-axis will denote the direction of 0°N 0°E (known as [Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island)), the y-axis will denote the direction of 0°N 180°E, and the z-axis will denote the direction of the North Pole. As for the radius of the earth, we shall use the value of the mean radius as obtained [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius), 6,371,008.7714 m."
